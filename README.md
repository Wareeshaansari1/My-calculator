# My-calculator
This TypeScript calculator, built for the Governor's House AI Metaverse course assignment, tackles basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides two calculation modes for flexibility:

Same Operation: Enter multiple numbers and a single operator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to perform a series of calculations with the same operation (e.g., 2 + 3 + 4 for addition or 10 - 5 - 2 for subtraction).
Mixed Operations: Craft complex equations by combining various operators within a single expression (e.g., 2 + 9 - 10 / 18).
This project demonstrates the power of TypeScript to structure well-defined code for a versatile calculator.
